## Iterators

#### Binary search tree: map in c++
```C++

               2
               
        1           5
                4       6
            3

```



```C++
    auto P = myTree.begin(); //first is determined by the properties of data structure
    while(!P.done())

    auto Stop = myTree.end();
    while(P!=Stop){
        T x = *P;
        ++P;
    }

Range: [b,e) | b=begin, e=end
```

In case of binary tree, end is a `nullptr`. Iterate until you hit nullptr

**Three operators are absolutly required: `=`, `*`, `++`**

In c++ iterators are Proxies.

In c, pointer operations:

p and q are iterators, k is int

1. `*P` => T
2. `p==q` => bool
3. `++p` => iterator //special case of p + k in C
4. `--p` => iterator //special case of p + k in C
5. `p + k` => iterator
6. `q - p` => iterator


`p!=q` ---> `!(p==q)`
`p-2`  ---> `p + -2`
`p[k]` ---> `*(p+k)`


##### 3 classes of iterators
```
forward_iterator: LinkedList, Hashtable
bi-directional iteartor: Binary Search Tree
random acess iterator: Vector
```

Conventions:
* iterator type is `DataStructure::iterator` or `DataStructure::const_iterator`
* `begin()` or `begin() const` method
* `end()` or `end() const` method
* `iterator::value_type` not expected anymore. ===> `typeof(*p)`
* `decltype` is used now.
* `iterator::iterator_category` essential. Has to be a type.  `std::forward_iterator_tag`


```C++
//implementation of forward_iterator_tag
struct forward_iterator_tag{};
```


`const iterator` creates a class that can't be modified but we need that
object can't be modified. hence `const_iterator`

```C++
/*Binary search tree*/
p = myTree.begin();
++p;
*p = 42; //Broke the tree..

```

##### Java
```Java
T x = p.next(); //read the value and advance the pointer
```
