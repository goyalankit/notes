#### Exceptions

```C++
p = x.begin();
x.pop_front(); //SEVERE : p is invalid. 
p = p - 2; //It should throw an exception. 'use' of the iterator. p is
no longer on legitimate position.
p = p + 2;
*p = 42;
```

```C++
//This would also certainly work
p = x.begin();
p = p - 2;
p = p + 2; //p is out of bounds here. p is not invalidated.
*p = 42;
```

Member function in a template class is itself a template function. If
you need to define later in the file, you need to specify template
<...>.

```C++

template <typename T, typename... Args > //one argument T, and optional template arguments.
T* make_thing(Args... args){
    return new T(args...);
}

```
