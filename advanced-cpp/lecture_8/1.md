#### Lecture 8


1. use `++p` instead of `p++` because `p++` will most probably create a new
copy.

2. `e-b` is possible only for random iterators.

3. `using` is an alterative of `typedef`

   `using value_type = T;` -> `T` is an existing type.

`auto` value shall be deduced.

if you ask the question are you random access. and it is not, then the
    coressponding method doesn't exist. But the compler needs to compile
    both if and else part of the code


 => use templates expanstion. If the method is never used then it is not
 compiled.

 `std::forward_iterator_tag` used for object idetification.
 `std::forward_iterator_tag` is an empty struct.

 overload the method using tags.


 ```
vector<int>::iterator it = x.begin();

*push_back(42); //invalidates p
*p = 3; //undefined behaviour

 ```

 ```
//How does this works?
vector x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

//conversion
{1,2,3,4,5} -> std::initializer_list<int>
vector::vector(const std::initializer_list<T>& my_list){
    my_list.begin();
    my_list.end();
}

 ```
