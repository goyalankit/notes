#### Inheritance - 2

```C++
class Base{
    int x;
    virtual void doit(void) { cout << "Base" << endl; }
    virtual ~Base(void) {} //instroduces a 8bytes pointer.
};
```

```

Base b;
b.doit();

|-------------| <-----this
|  x = 42     |
|             | base
| ------------|
|       .----------> |pointer|(8 bytes) [ table contains entries for each function] =====>>> Base::vft_ptr (data member => pointer)
|-------------|

//size of each object increased by 8 bytes.


// one virtual table per class - BASE::vft(array label)
// arbitrary order of functions (may be order of declaration)
[ offset | address(doit)  ] 
[ offset | address(~Base) ]
```

* `Base::vft_ptr` cannot be accessed directly. But it is present as a
  data member.


For a dynamic invocation:
* method has to be virtual
* object has to be a reference or pointer. If not then it's a plain
  object.

Even if there is no derived class, compiler still have to generate
vtable and dynamic lookup.
```
Base *b = new Base();
b.doit();
// this is because, class may be derived later.
```

```
/* Try this out. Test. */

void doit(void){}

using ptr_fun = void(*)(void)

void (*p)(void) = &doit; //function pointer
p = &Base::doit; //illegal assignment. needs an implicit this parameter.

(*p)(); //calling the function. for global it works.

b.(*p)(); //compiler needs an implicit this parameter.
```


```
// Assign p the address of the member function
void (Base *p)(void) = &Base::doit;
(b.*p)();

// works only when there is not inheritance.
this =  &b
sub(*p)
```



**Pointer to member function has to be a pair in c++**
Pair of (pointer to function, offset in the derived object)


```
p = &Base::doit;
//compiler here can calculate the pinter and offset here. Creating a pair.


if something
    p = &Base1::doit()
else    
    p = &Base2::doit()


(d.*p)(); //compiler here doesn't know which base class does p belongs
          // to. It needs to set the `this` offset to appropriate object.


```


```
// if derived is inhereting from base1. compiler will create :
Derived::doit1(){
    Base1::doit1();    
}

```
