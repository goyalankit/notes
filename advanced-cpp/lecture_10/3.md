#### Casting

```c++
Base *p = new Derived{};
.
.
Derived *d = p; //compiler checks this independently. 
// so you need to explicitly cast. DOWN CASTING needs to be explicitly casted.

Derived *d = static_cast<Derived*>(p); // (Derived *) - c cast could be
                                       // used here

           = dynamic_cast<Double*>(p); // runtime type checking;
             // returns nullptr or correct address.

// returns a nullptr
Base * = new Base;
Derived *d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(p);

//dynamic cast   
if(p->vft_ptr == &Derived::vft) 
                 //table

runtime type id only when you have virtual method. 
if there are no virtual functions defined in the base
dynamic cast will give error. Eventhough there are virtual functions in
derived class.

dynamic cast provides type safety. c-style cast is not type case. it may
return type of wrong object.

Java only supports dynamic cast. static cast checks the objects are
related.

Base *p = new Base;
Derived *d = static_cast<Derived*>(p); //p class is related to derived. 
d->eat_chocolate() // gives an error.
```

```
Base{

    virtual ~Base(void) {}  

    //virtual distrucotr are important if there are objects on the heap.
    //compiler needs to run the correct destructor.
    //by default it will run the destructor of base and all the  derived
    //part will leak.

    //if you are going to derive....create desctruter VIRTUAL

}
```
