### Code Reuse

```
class Foo { ... }

//specialize. Everything the Foo has and add some extra features.
class Bar : public Foo {
    void doit(void){ ... }
}
```

* private inheritance is default
 * public components of the base class are private to the derived class.
```C++
// private inheritance. Not very useful.
class Bar : Foo{
    
    
}

//alternative
class Bar{

    Foo foo;    

}
```

* Everything is inherited except 
    * constructors (copy constructor is sort-of inherited. Others can be
      explicitly them)

```
//Explicit inherit constructor
using Bar();
```

Every class has a default copy constructor. Compiler will use the copy
constructor of base class to generate default.

---

```
class Bar{
    void doIt(int){ ... }
}

class Derived : public Base{
    //overridden the function do it in c++. Not in java.
    void doit(myType){ ... } // <--- overrides Base doit; override by name not by signature.

    // if you want to inherit base class function that are overridden.
    // You need to do it explicitly.
    void doit(int x) { Base::doit(x); }
}
```

* Assignment operators have wrong return type.
```
derived : a, b, c

a = (b = c);
    { base }
```
---

```
class Base {
    int x;
    void doit(void) { x = 42;}
}

derived : public Base {
    int y;    

    void der_doit(void) {
        y = 10;
        doit();
    }

}
```

```

Derived Object

|-------------| <-----this
|  x = 42     |
|             | base
| ------------|
| y = 10      | derived
|-------------|
```

Since derived is just concatinated to base.

```
Derived d;
d.Base::doit(); // to call the overide method.
```

* compiler doesn't need to know about the machine code for base class
  method. since `this` is the same. compiler just needs to convert the call to
  proper name. Base::doit_base(this..). -> `this` is the same

* compiler do need to have layout of the base class to be able to
  derive.


* overriding a new data component - you are just shadowing it not
  redefining it. Scope resolution will take care of it.

```
Derived array[10];
array[k].doit(); //works fine

// pointer arithmatic won't work. It's just skipping by the size of base class.
Base *p = array; 
```
---

### Multiple Inheritance

```

class Base1{
 int x;
 void doit(void){ x = 42; }    
}

class Base2{
 int y;
 void doit2(void){... }    
}


class Derived : public Base1, public Base2{
    int z;    

}

```

```

Derived Object
|-------------| <----- this
|  x = 42     |
|             | base1 for Base1:: or Derived::
|-------------| <------ this
|  y          |
|             | base2 for Base2::
|-------------|
| z           | derived
|-------------|
```

Derived d;
d.doit2(); // compiler needs to set the offset for this base class.

if you are deriving the base class from derived class: compiler will add
    the offset.

if you are deriving the derived class from base class compiler will
    subtract the offset.

that is what `static_cast< >`, `dynamic_cast< >` `(Base2*)` do

`reinterpret_as`(check?) doesn't do offset calculation

---

```C++
// stack has only parameter space for base class. Compiler truncates the
// derived component. It's for the copy operation.

fun(Base b){
}

main(){
Derived d;
fun(d);    
}


// if you pass the reference. compiler just passes it on. It doesn't
// truncate(no need).

fun(Base &b){
    // no truncation
}
```

---

* `protected` in base class can be accessed in derived class. Not to the clients.

```C++
T::doit(){
    R::x;
    // R must be base class for T.
}

// ---------------

List::append(Object x){
    Object y = x.clone    // won't work
}

```

---

### Ploymorphism

```C++
fun(Base* p){
    p->doit(); // by default, c++ selects the method statically. 
};

class Base{
    void doit(void){       

    }

    // To make the above p->doit be decided at runtime.
    //virtual void doit(void){}

}

class Derived : public Base {
  void doit(void) { ... }  
}

```

**Runtime selection conditions: virtual + object needs to be a reference.**


#### Runtime type identification

```

Derived Object
|-------------| <----- this
|  x = 42     |
|             | base
|-------------| 
|  RTTI       |
|             |
|-------------|
| z           | derived
|-------------|
```


if you make a method virtual you are adding a data component to your
    object in the base class.

static array of pointer to functions
