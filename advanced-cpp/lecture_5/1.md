### Move semantics

```C++
Foo::Foo(const Foo&);
Foo::Foo(Foo&&);
```

```C++
S				  F	
|				  |
[][][][][][][][][]
  |			 |  
  b			 e
  
  copy
  
S				 F	
|				 |
[][][][][][][][][]
|				 |  
b				 e
  
  
```

**It becomes highly inefficient to perform a deep copy.**

```C++
Vector<T> getData(input){
	result.push_back(value);
	return result;
}

main(){
	Vector<T> myVector;
	/*if a new copy is made here, it becomes highly inefficient*/
	myVector = getData(...); 
	
	/* we may require pass-by-value semantics here. If a shallow copy is performed here, the original vector will be changed. */
	doit(myVector); 
	/*Solution: make a new copy only when the vector is changed. 
	*
	* COPY-ON-WRITE + Reference count. 
	* List of mutators: push_back, pop_back, op[] -> these methods will force deep copy.
	* If a mutation is made, only then copy is performed					
	* Destroy based on reference count.
	*/
	
	doit(const Vector<T> &param){  } //passing by reference, no copy.
	
	myVector.pop_back();
}
```

**Design decisions:**

* Always make a shallow copy and make destructor smart enough that there are more than 1 referrences and should not free copy. Keep track of reference count.

```C++
class Foo{
	int *p;
	int l;
	public:
	
	/*Not a mutating method. To indicate that, you can attach const keyword*/
	/*const here is part of method signrature.*/
	int size(void) const{
		return l; //compiler sees that you are reading a memory location.
	}
	
	//const is part of signature. C++ allows you to define two methods with const and without const
	//you cannot call non-const methods using from const params.
	//Overload based on const.
	
	/*Non-const method vs const method*/
	const Foo * this; //in const method implicit this object is const Foo
	Foo * this; //in non-const this is the method
	
	//Version 1:
	int Foo::operator[](int k) const{
		return p[k]; //not modifying foo. Can be declared constant
	}
	
	//Version 2:
	//returns reference. To compiler it's still a const method. But it is returning refernce and could be modified.
	//You shouldn't delare it as const eventhough compiler allows you to.
	//returns the memory location and you can change.
	
	int& Foo::operator[](int k) ~const~{
		return p[k]; 
	}
	
	//Version 3:
	int Foo::operator[](int k) const{
		return p[k]; //not modifying foo. Can be declared constant
	}	
}
```

In the above example one the [] becomes mutator. Only one has to perform a deep copy.

**COPY-ON-WRITE is not very useful**: will be either covered by move semantics or by the developer by using const.

```C++
/* Foo had two implementations of []. const and non-const*/
doit(Vector<T> params){
	cout << params[t]; //no copy. Rvalue forces the deep copy. compiler makes the wrong choice here, compiler doesn't see any const and sees params as a non-const. Enventhough the context required only Rvalue, compiler will choose non-const method.
	params[k] = 42; //copy now. non const []
}
```

```C++
//Copy on write useful here.
/* Challenge: How to differentiate between lvalue and rvalue based on the context. */
doit(Vector<T> params){
	if(unlikely)
		params[k] = 42;
	else
		cout << params[t]; //compiler looks at declared type of the variable.
	
}

```

#### Rvalue references `&&` 
Design challenge. sometimes shallow copies are useful and sometimes not. 

Anything you return in c++ is immediate a candidate for an rvalue reference.

```C++
//Rvalues are created for things that don't have a name.
Foo && doit(){ 
	return object;
}

x = doit();
```

```C++
push_back(T&& x){
			
	//Version 1:		
	new(pointer) T(x); //copy constructor gets called. Any use of x is an lvalue.
	//x = 42 compiler doesn't know. you could use it here. and here it becomes an lvalue
	
	//Version 2:
	new(pointer) T((T&&)x); //You can type cast to explicitly tell that it's a temp variable.
	new(pointer) T(std::move(x)); //another way to type cast.
}

push_back(doit())

```

Example:

```C++
main(){
	std::string x="hello";
	std::string y(std::move(x));
	cout << x; //may or may not work. **Destructor should work though.**
}

```
