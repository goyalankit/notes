### Standard Template Library

1. Generic w.r.t. element type.
2. Generic w.r.t container type(data structures).
3. Predictable time complexity.
4. Efficiency comparable to hand-written.

#### STL vs JAVA
STL considers Array as a container. In java arrays are not part of
collections library.

Rather than passing a pointer to function, pass object instead. This
will help in the inlining of the function
