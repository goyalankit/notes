## Type 1 Hypervisor:

### Bare metal virtualization

* Multiple operating systems on the same bare metal. 
* live migration of os from one server to another in case of failures -> redundancy, fault toulerance.

How it works..
- **Storage**: where the actual data is stored - can be on the hypervisor - or SAN/NAS
- Type 1 **hypervisor** installed on bare-metal.
- **Management console** - to administor/control hypervisor

---

* VMware ESXI - storage
* hypervisor - XEN Always free
* Management - usually paid. VSphere.

**XEN** ---> type 1 hypervisor part of ESXI, Citrix => ALWAYS FREE.
